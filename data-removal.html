<p>To request to have your NOMAD data removed, please email nomad@billhinderman.com with the subject "NOMAD: DATA REMOVAL", using the following template:</p>

<p>I am hereby requesting immediate erasure of personal data concerning me [YOUR NAME], according to Article 17 of the GDPR.</p>

<p>Please erase all personal data concerning me as defined by GDPR Article 4(1).</p>

<p>I am of the opinion that the requirements set forth in GDPR Article 17(1) are fulfilled. You cannot claim an exception based on GDPR Article 17(3) either, particularly as I am not a public figure.</p>

<p>If I have given consent to the processing of my personal data (e.g. according to GDPR Article 6(1) or Article 9(2)), I am hereby withdrawing said consent for the entire process. In addition, I am objecting to the processing of personal data concerning me (which includes profiling), according to GDPR Article 21. I request that you restrict the processing of the data concerning me pending the verification whether your legitimate grounds override mine, pursuant to GDPR Article 18(1)(d).</p>

<p>If you have made the aforementioned data public, you are obliged pursuant to GDPR Article 17(2) to take all reasonable steps to inform other controllers, including search engine operators, who process the personal data listed above, that I have requested the erasure of all links, copies or replications. This applies not only to exact copies of the data concerned, but also to those from which information contained in the data concerned can be derived.</p>

<p>In case you have disclosed the affected personal data to third parties, you have to communicate my request for erasure of the affected personal data, as well as any references to it, to each recipient as laid down in GDPR Article 19. Please also inform me about those recipients.</p>

<p>If you object to the requested erasure, you have to justify that to me.</p>

<p>My request explicitly includes any other services and companies for which you are the controller as defined by GDPR Article 4(7).</p>

<p>As laid down in GDPR Article 12(3), you have to confirm the erasure to me without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request.</p>

<p>I am including the following information necessary to identify me: [YOUR NAME & ADDRESS]</p>

<p>If you do not answer my request within the stated period, I am reserving the right to take legal action against you and to lodge a complaint with the responsible supervisory authority.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
